## Known issues

This package depends on mashape-analytics which itself has some dependencies.  
Mashape-analytics requires specific versions of its dependencies.  CKAN also
has some dependencies, some of which overlap those of mashape-analytics.  In some
cases the required versions may be incompatible.  Suggested work arounds:

1. run ckanext-galileo in its own virtualenv
2. await an update to mashape analytics that fixes this issue:
